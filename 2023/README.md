# Advent of Code 2023 with C++

## Overview

As a starting point for AOC 2024 I wanted to get a little experience with C++ before this year's (2024) AOC started.
I have around 6 days to do a couple examples and learn as much as I can, so that I am not completely confused when the calendar drops.
Most likely I will come back to this calendar and finish it either in C++ or with another language.
