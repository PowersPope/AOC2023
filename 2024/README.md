# AOC 2024

## Overview
This year I am working through all of the challenges in C++17. I have never really used C++, so I will be learning and using C++.
Hopefully this will jumpstart my knowledge for starting to contribute to Open Source projects. 
My implementations will probably not be great, so don't use these as good C++ scripts! lol
