# AOC 2024

## Overview
This year I am working through all of the challenges in C++17. I have never really used C++ before, so I will be learning everything on the fly.
Hopefully this will get me to a good base level for starting to contribute to Open Source projects and making tools of my own. 
We will see how much I can learn in a month! :)
